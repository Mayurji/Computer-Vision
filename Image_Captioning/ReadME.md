### Image Captioning

Image Captioning is one of the biggest challenges in Computer Vision, as it involves couple of crucial ideas. 
First, understanding the image and then secondly, presenting it through utterances like humans do. 

### Models:

  **To understand the image, we use ResNet model for extracting the feature. (Try different models if required.)**
  
  **Word Embedding generated from the captions is used in RNN for generating sequences based on Image Features**
