## Advance CNN

A normal CNN classifier finds the classification of image like dogs, person etc, where we have few Convolutional Layers 
and Pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. But identifying and then tracking the identified objects requires more
than just convolutional layers.

There are many models which helps in locating and identifying an object in an image or video such as R-CNN, FastR-CNN, 
FasterR-CNN, YOLO, SSD etc to name few. But each model is slightly a improved version of one other either based on compution 
or accurately tracking the object in an Image or Video.
