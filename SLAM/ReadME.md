## Objective

To derive a map from a **Point** as it traverses through the 2D world with help of movements and landmarks, 
which are generated randomly.

### Technique

SLAM - [Simultaneous Localization and Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping)
is the computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously 
keeping track of an agent's location within it.
