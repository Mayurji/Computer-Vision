### Face Augmentation:
    1.It imports the functions from opencv.py file, we can apply any function from opencv and augment data 
    as needed including cropping, accessing pixels, drawing shapes etc.

### Face Detection:
    1.Using Haarcascade Frontal Face Detector, we can detect the faces and store it seperately.
    2.Using OpenCV, we can apply any of the augmentation technique like rotation, flipping, translation
      as required.

### Under Images Folder:
  
    1.File mayur.jpg is the file on which GAN network is trained.
  
    2.GANS with Adam .0002 Folder contains the files which are generated by the GAN network, 
    the folder contains 10 files which are captured in the iteration mentioned in file name. 
    Greater the iteration better the face generated.
    
    
### Trained on Images:
