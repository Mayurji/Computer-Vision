## Recurrent Neural Network

In this section, I will be focusing on Recurrent Neural Network and its variant LSTM (Long Short Term Memory). We use RNN 
when our output not only depend on the current but also at the previous inputs.

LSTM is one of the widely used RNN variant, which has wide application in speech recognition, Audio Synthesis, Stock 
Forecasting etc.
