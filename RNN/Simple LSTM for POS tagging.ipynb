    "In this section, we will use an LSTM to predict part-of-speech tags for words. What exactly is part-of-speech tagging?\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of speech tagging is the process of determining the category of a word from the words in its surrounding context. You can think of part of speech tagging as a way to go from words to their Mad Libs categories. Mad Libs are incomplete short stories that have many words replaced by blanks. Each blank has a specified word-category, such as \"noun\", \"verb\", \"adjective\", and so on. One player asks another to fill in these blanks (prompted only by the word-category) until they have created a complete, silly story of their own."

    "### Why Tag Speech?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tagging parts of speech is often used to help disambiguate natural language phrases because it can be done quickly and with high accuracy. It can help answer: what subject is someone talking about? Tagging can be used for many NLP tasks like creating new sentences using a sequence of tags that make sense together, filling in a Mad Libs style game, and determining correct pronunciation during speech synthesis. It is also used in information retrieval, and for word disambiguation (ex. determining when someone says right like the direction versus right like \"that's right!\")."
