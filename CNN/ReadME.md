## Convolutional Neural Network

  * CNN is a deep learning architecture, primarily used for classifying images. CNN architecture consists of number of layers,
    to detect the features of the image and classify the image based on the feature.
    
    CNN Layers:
      * Convolution Layer
      * RELU
      * Pooling Layer
      * FC Layer
      * Softmax
