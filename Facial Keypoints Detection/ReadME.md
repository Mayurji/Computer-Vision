The Project deals with detecting the facial keypoints on an Image which contains faces. The Keypoints refer to features 
of faces like eyes, nose, mouth etc. To detect the facial keypoints, we are training a CNN model and it is a regression 
problem as the value of the keypoint in an image is varies quantitatively.
