## Facial Keypoints Detection

In pre-requisite notebook, we learn how face is detected using Haarcascade classifier. Now adding to that, we are implementing
Facial Keypoint Detection using Kaggle Dataset followed by applying a filter on top of the detected keypoints of the face. Here, Filter refers to filter like dog filter in snapchat.

### Dataset:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection

### Libraries required

  * OpenCV
  * Numpy
  * Pytorch or Keras for CNN implementation
  * Matplotlib
  
**Lesson Learnt: personally, the key lesson here is understanding the filter like image here(Moustach), its color format, assignment of keypoint, understanding the regression problem its loss function / activation function.**
