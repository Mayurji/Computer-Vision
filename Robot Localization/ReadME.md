In this section, We'll look into basic but yet significant technique of localization been followed by 
Self Driving Car, Sense and Move.

In simple terms, a initial probability distribution of object (Car) is constant or uniformly distributed. 
When Sensor senses environment, the probability distribution is updated towards that environment. If required,
we can make a move based on the current probability distribution.
