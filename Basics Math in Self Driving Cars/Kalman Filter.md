### Kalman Filter

**It uses Gaussian distribution for tracking an object. Consider a object(vehicle) moving at certain speed, which is represented 
by a Gaussian distribution(Prior Distribution) with mean(m) and variance(v) and then a measurement update(sensor) occurs which has its own new mean(M) and 
variance(V), now to identify the new location with help of prior distribution and measurement update, we use gaussian distribution
and other mathematical notation as mentioned in notebook to get new mean and variance for measurement update and motion update.**
